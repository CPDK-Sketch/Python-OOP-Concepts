# Python OOP Concepts 🚀

This repository contains Python programs demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** with **real-world applications**.

## 📌 Concepts Covered
✅ 1. Classes & Objects  - Object - object is like a self-contained unit with its own data and the ability to perform actions ; Class - Blue print or template for creating objects.
✅ 2. Inheritance -  create new kinds of objects that are based on existing ones
✅ 3. Polymorphism  - treat different kinds of objects in a similar way, as long as they share a common interface
✅ 4. Encapsulation - keeping the details of how an object works hidden inside the object, so can change those details without breaking the rest of the program
✅ 5. Abstraction -  simplifies complex systems by focusing on essential features and interactions, hiding unnecessary details.
✅ 6. Method Overriding  


## 🔥 How to Use
1. Click on any `.py` file to view the code.
2. Copy and run it in an any python compiler which you prefer 
3. Modify and experiment with the examples.
